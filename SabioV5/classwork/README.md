# Help Creating New Files

It is easy to generate the tempalte code for a new file.

1. Be sure you have the Sabio Extenstion installed. Search for "Sabio PreWork" in the extensions tab of the Side bar.

2. Once installed, open or create a new HTML file (a file with ".html" extension). Within this file start to type out "sabio" in lowercase letters.

3. You will see that autocomplete will kick in and you will be given a "sabio" option that references "Sabio PreWork Tempalte Generator"

4. Just "Tab" or click on the option and you are good to go!
